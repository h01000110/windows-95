# This is an example of a post with the "image2" icon

To use this, add `filetype: image` to the top in the [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) section.

It will appear as this image in the post list:

![large image icon](/assets/img/image.ico)

And it will have this image in the topbar of the window:

![small image icon](/assets/img/image.png)

# Image Types

The `<FILENAME>.png` is used for the small icons in the topbar. The `<FILENAME>.ico` image filetype is used for the larger icon that shows up in the post list.
